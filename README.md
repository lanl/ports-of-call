# Ports of call

Utilities for Performance Portability

A complete set of documentation is available [here](https://lanl.github.io/ports-of-call)

## Summary

We define a few portability macros which are useful:

1. `PORTABLE_FUNCTION`: decorators necessary for compiling a kernel function
2. `PORTABLE_INLINE_FUNCTION`: ditto, but for when functions ought to be inlined
3. `_WITH_KOKKOS_`: Defined if Kokkos is enabled.
4. `_WITH_CUDA_`: Defined when Cuda is enabled
5. `Real`: a typedef to double (default) or float (if you define
`SINGLE_PRECISION_ENABLED`)
6. `PORTABLE_MALLOC()`, `PORTABLE_FREE()`: A macro or wrapper for
   kokkos_malloc or cudaMalloc, or raw malloc.

At compile time, you define `PORTABILITY_STRATEGY_{KOKKOS,CUDA,NONE}` (if you don't
define it, it defaults to NONE).

There are to be two headers in this folder, for different use cases.

### portability.hpp

- Provides certain macros for decorating functions, lambdas, etc.  Also
provides device malloc/device free operations. This is the principle
path for turning on/off Kokkos. 
- Provides loop abstractions that can be leveraged by the code.  

### portable_array.hpp:

Provides an implementation of a multidimensional array with round
parentheses access. Could be a Kokkos view or something that is not
portable
